## Usage

You can define some options:

* __-logins, -passwords__ — files where your logins and passwords are stored; it looks for «logins» and «passwords» by default;
* __-check__ — very useful, but still experimental option which allows to check a host before trying to log in (I did some reverse-engineering and I'm not really sure if everything is OK);
* __-shoots__ — a directory where pictures from cameras will be stored; it doesn't download pictures by default;
* __-threads__ — there's no multithreading until you define in how many threads you want to do a job;
* __-csv__ — write results to CSV file.

__Please note that it is hardcoded to read IPs from file called “hosts”!__

A typical cammand is:

hikkavision-recover -threads 200 -check -shoots pics/
